  -Given a number n, return the fibonnaci series upto n.
  
2. Longest Common Subsequence:
  -Given two Strigns P and Q, Return the longest common subsequence among them. 
  -It is not necessary that the characters in the substring be in contigious order.
  -eg. Given, P="BAATD" and Q="BASD", the LCS="BAD"
